# Getting started with Plastic SCM for Unity (beta)

**Note**: Plastic SCM for Unity is available via the Version Control package in the Unity Package Manager.

Plastic SCM for Unity will allow you to use Plastic SCM directly in Unity.

**Important**: Enabling the Plastic SCM for Unity package will disable the standard VCS integration option in the Project Settings (this option will be removed from future Editor releases), which was an older integration previously offered in the Editor. Features available in the standard integration have been ported to the Plastic SCM for Unity package. This is the version that will be actively developed and maintained going forward.
