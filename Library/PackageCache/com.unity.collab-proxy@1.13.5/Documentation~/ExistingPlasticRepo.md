# Getting started with an existing Plastic SCM repository

Suppose you want to start working on a Unity project in an existing Plastic SCM repository and already have a Plastic SCM account linked to your Unity ID. In that case, you will be able to open the project straight from the **Unity Hub**! A workspace will automatically be created for your project on your machine.


* In **Hub v3 Beta**, select **Open** &gt; **Open Remote Project** to see the list of your Plastic SCM repositories that contain a Unity project.
* In **Hub 2.4.4** and up, your Plastic SCM projects will be listed alongside Collaborate projects.
